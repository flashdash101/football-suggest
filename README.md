## This is a football scout recommender, it simply recommends players based on the categories you chose, if you want ideas for a possession minded defensive midfielder then this is the right program for you!

### How does it work?
- it utilizes a weighting feature system accounting for varying importances of statistics across different playing positions and styles
- It takes into account 1,000 professional players from top European leagues
- KMeans clustering is used for player sub role inference, giving flexiibilty as players may not fit a specfic category and finally it uses Monte Carlo simulations to give the best results
